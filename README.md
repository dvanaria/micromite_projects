# micromite_projects
A "Micromite" is a PIC32 (specifically a PIC32MX170F256B microcontroller) loaded with special firmware: MMBASIC, a modern BASIC interpreter and embedded OS created by Geoff Graham in 2014. This allows working on embedded/microcontroller projects using a beginner-friendly language, a modernized BASIC langauge that is similar to GW-BASIC from back in the day.
